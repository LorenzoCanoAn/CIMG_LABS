# CImg - Laboratory 2 

The following files have been modified in order to recreate the laboratory steps requested.

 - my_imfilter.m
 - hybrid_image.m
 

## Launch ðŸš€

pruebas.m: Test my_imfilter.m function, applying a kernel to an image. The parameters to be tunned are:
	- picture_name = image name
	- picture_format = image format
	- picture_path = image path
	- kernel = kernel to be applied
	

hybrid_image.m
	- image_path = image path
	- img_1_name = 1st image name with extension - high frequency
 	- img_2_name = 2nd image name with extension - low frequency

	Run Steps:
		1st: Select the parts of both images to be align
		2nd: Select a squared area of interest of the images, to reduce de empty mixed parts of the images.
