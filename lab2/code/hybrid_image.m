% Before trying to construct hybrid images, it is suggested that you
% implement my_imfilter.m and then debug it using proj1_test_filtering.m

% Debugging tip: You can split your MATLAB code into cells using "%%"
% comments. The cell containing the cursor has a light yellow background,
% and you can press Ctrl+Enter to run just the code in that cell. This is
% useful when projects get more complex and slow to rerun from scratch

close all; % closes all figures

%% Setup
% read images and convert to floating point format.
image1 = ;
image2 = ;

% align the images
[image1, image2] = ;

% Several additional test cases are provided for you, but feel free to make
% your own (you'll need to align the images in a photo editor such as
% Photoshop). The hybrid images will differ depending on which image you
% assign as image1 (which will provide the low frequencies) and which image
% you asign as image2 (which will provide the high frequencies)

%% Filtering and Hybrid Image construction
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% YOUR CODE BELOW. Use my_imfilter create 'low_frequencies' and
% 'high_frequencies' and then combine them to create 'hybrid_image'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%% Visualize and save outputs
figure(1); imshow(low_frequencies)
figure(2); imshow(high_frequencies + 0.5);
vis = vis_hybrid_image(hybrid_image);
figure(3); imshow(vis);
imwrite(low_frequencies, 'low_frequencies.jpg', 'quality', 95);
imwrite(high_frequencies + 0.5, 'high_frequencies.jpg', 'quality', 95);
imwrite(hybrid_image, 'hybrid_image.jpg', 'quality', 95);
imwrite(vis, 'hybrid_image_scales.jpg', 'quality', 95);
