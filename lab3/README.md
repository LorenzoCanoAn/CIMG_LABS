# CImg - Laboratory 3

The following files have been created and used for achieving the task proposed at Laboratory 3.

 - Ex1.m    -> Implements Part 1 and 4
 - Ex2.m	-> Implements Part 2 
 - deblurring_demo_*.m -> Implements Part 3
 

## Launch ðŸš€

Ex1.m:
	 - aperture -> Aperture kernel to be applied
	 - image	-> image to process

	 - sigma	-> Noise level (gaussian noise)
	 - blurSize -> equivalent to focal distance
	
Ex2.m:
	 - aperture -> Aperture kernel to be applied
	 - image	-> image to process

	 - sigma	-> Noise level (gaussian noise)
	 - blurSize -> equivalent to focal distance
	
deblurring_demo_*.m:
	 - aperture -> Aperture kernel to be applied
	 - image	-> image to process

	 - sigma	-> Noise level (gaussian noise)
	 - blurSize -> equivalent to focal distance
