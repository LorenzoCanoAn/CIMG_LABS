# Lab 4 CIMG

## Overall structure

The project has been divided in various functions, so that it is easier to work with using github.

The file "lab4.m" calls this functions and implements both the global and local tone mapping, so no individual calling of the functions is necessary.

## How to use

By giving the path to a folder containing the images. The name of the files MUST be of the format:

{a}_{b}.{format}, so that a/b = exposure time of the image.

The parameters of the methods can be tweaked on the lab4.m file, on the different sections defined in the script.
